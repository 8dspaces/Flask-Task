Welcome to Wooey's documentation
================================

Wooey is a simple web interface to run command line Python scripts. Think of it as an easy way to get your scripts
up on the web for routine data analysis, file processing, or anything else.

The project was inspired by how simply and powerfully [sandman](https://github.com/jeffknupp/sandman)
could expose users to a database and by how [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) turns
ArgumentParser-based command-line scripts into WxWidgets GUIs. Originally two separate
projects (Django-based djangui by [Chris Mitchell](https://github.com/Chris7) and Flask-based Wooey by
[Martin Fitzpatrick](https://github/mfitzp)) it has been merged to combine our efforts.
